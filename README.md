This project was developed during the Trybe development course. The project is an informative website about a soccer championship that contains both standings and match tables. The front-end provides the information which is then sent to the back-end through an API, and subsequently stored in the database. I was responsible for developing the entire back-end and database, while the front-end was developed by the Trybe team.

## Concepts:
- RESTfull API;
- Object Oriented Programing (OOP) paradigm;

## Technologies:
- C#
